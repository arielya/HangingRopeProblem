# Helicopter Rope Riddle

This repository was made after waching the YouTube video from [Dr. Derek Muller of Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-_7y0WUnW4) about a question the qualifying exam for the 2014 US Physics Olympiad team. The question was: How does a uniform cable beneath a helicopter hang? A, B, or C may seem like a straightforward question, but the answer isn’t quite so obvious.

I applied the laws of motion and aerodynamic analysis to develop a differential equation to discover the right answer mathematically. The problem itself is complex, as the nonlinear aerodynamic forces are not neglectable. Their behavior is not intuitive; when a stream faces a surface, the resultant force doesn’t apply in the same direction as the stream.

You can find in this repository two file, the first one with an article that describe the problem and its mathematical solution, the second one is the code to solve the differential eaquation.
